h2. DESCRIPTION

Events is a simple events library for CodeIgniter (all versions)

h2. INSTALLATION

1.  Copy Events.php to your application/libraries folder.
2.  Load it like normal: @$this->load->library('events');@ (or autoload it).

h2. USAGE

All Events functions are static.

You can add a listener to an event with the register() function:

<pre><code>Events::register('event_name_here', array('class_name_or_object_ref', 'method_name'));</code></pre>

The second parameter of register() is an array that is callable via "call_user_func()":http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php.

You trigger an Event by calling the trigger() function:

<pre><code>$event_return = Events::trigger('event_name_here', $data, 'string');</code></pre>

The 3rd parameter is the type of data you wish trigger() to return.  Your options are as follows:

* 'array'
* 'json'
* 'serialized'
* 'string' (the default)
